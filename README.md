  I've used Java for almost six years at this point, and many of my projects are written in Java, ranging from reverse engineering to compilers.

  I've worked with Groovy a fair bit for some private projects and an old version of ModernProtobuf, now Groovy is no longer used. 
  I've also used Python for many medium-sized private projects, mainly around web scraping and automation.

- ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) ![Typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
  
  I've had to learn Javascript and Typescript to contribute to some open-source projects like [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys).
  I also use them regularly when reverse engineering web apps.

- ![Dart](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dart-0175C2?style=for-the-badge&logo=dart&logoColor=white) ![Flutter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter-%2302569B.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Flutter&logoColor=white)

  I've used Dart mainly for Flutter, but I also have some backends from a long time ago here on GitHub.
  Talking about Flutter, I've used it both for Mobile and Desktop development, I've also experimented with it on the Web(looking forward to full WASM support ðŸ™‚)
  You can check the Reboot Launcher repo if you want to try a publicly available program for Windows that follows the FluentUI spec developed using Flutter Desktop.

- ![Swift](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-FA7343?style=for-the-badge&logo=swift&logoColor=white)

  I've learned Swift to develop native apps for iOS and iPadOS. 
  If you are interested you can check out the Artemis repo, soon the app will also be available on the App Store.

- ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
  
  After a couple of years of using only Java, I learned C++ when I became interested in CS.
  As a result, most of my work there is around algorithms, but I've also used it to contribute to some open-source projects I like.
